# Architecture

In the `src` directory, the project should be organized this way:

- `src/lib`: Contains all the core libraries, components, modules, etc.
- `src/content`: Contains two subdirectories:
  - `src/content/posts`: Contains all the blog posts.
  - `src/content/pages`: Contains all the 'static' pages like `/contact`, `/about`, etc.
- `src:routes`: Contains all the route definitions and related files.
