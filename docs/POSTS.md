# Posts

`Posts` are Markdown files with metadata in the frontmatter. They are used to create blog posts, articles, and other types of content on your website.  
They should have:

- a title
- a summary
- a cover image
- a content (supporting images, code blocks, etc.)
- a publication date
- a published state (true or false)

They are rendered using [MDsveX](https://mdsvex.com/), which allows you to use Svelte components inside your Markdown files.
