Welcome to my new blog built with **SvelteKit** and **MDsveX**.

Before working hard, here is another beautiful image from Bretagne:

This is a sample post to demonstrate the markdown capabilities:

You can use inline code like `console.log()`, `const variable = 5`, or `import React from 'react'` within text paragraphs.

## Code Blocks

```javascript
function greet(name) {
 // Comment inside code block
 return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

```python
def greet(name):
    # hello this is a comment
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

NAME = "World"
x = 10
b = True

print(greet(NAME))
```

## Lists

- SvelteKit for the framework
- MDsveX for markdown processing
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Images

You can add images and they will be processed correctly.

## Conclusion

This blog supports all markdown features and Svelte components!
