Welcome to my new blog built with **SvelteKit** and **MDsveX**.

Before working hard, here is another beautiful image from Bretagne:

This is a sample post to demonstrate the markdown capabilities:

## Code Blocks

```javascript
function greet(name) {
 return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

## Lists

- SvelteKit for the framework
- MDsveX for markdown processing
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Images

You can add images and they will be processed correctly.

## Conclusion

This blog supports all markdown features and Svelte components!
